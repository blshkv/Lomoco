# Lomoco
Lomoco was created by Alexios Chouchoulas, Andreas Schneider &lt;andreas.schneider@linux-gamers.net>, and  Peter Feuerer &lt;peter.feuerer@linux-gamers.net>
It was designed to allow Logitech Mice to work on linux.

I am trying to revive it to do the following:
1. Disable the DPI increase/decrese buttons on the Logitech g400s (hopefully other logitech mice will be supported)
2. Manually set the DPI of a logitech mouse.
3. Free up the mouse buttons so that all of them can be used.
